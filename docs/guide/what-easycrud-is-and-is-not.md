## What Is Not

- Web Framework
- No Code/Low Code Platform

The main target of EASYCRUD is to make a set of utilities for faster development of CRUD web applications. We do concern about flexibility and extensibility, we don't want to be a heavy framework and provide out-of-the box features. The users of EASYCRUD are expected to have a basic understanding of web development and enjoy using the utilities to simplify their work.
