(we usually choose a relational database)</li><li>Develop CRUD API server.</li><li>Develop frontend, including data list tables and create/edit forms to retrive and update data via API.</li></ul><p>In this process, we have to write a lot of repetitive code, for example, we keep writing down the table column names, the data types across from SQL statements, frontend components, to API server. As data models are changed, we have to update the code in multiple places. When we have a new project with new data models, we have to repeat the same steps.</p><p>However, we don&#39;t want to use a full featured framework because many frameworks are too heavy and hard to customize. We&#39;d like to stay lean and flexible to develop our own business logic, but reduce the repetitive work.</p><p>Since data models are involved heavily during the development, we want focus on designing data models, leaving the repetitive work to tools. The tools are expected to help us generate the code for SQL statements, basic CRUD APIs, client and frontend components.</p><h2 id="drafting" tabindex="-1">Drafting <a class="header-anchor" href="#drafting" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="diagram"></p><h2 id="what-is-not" tabindex="-1">What Is Not <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-not" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><ul><li>Web Framework</li><li>No Code/Low Code Platform</li></ul><p>The main target of EASYCRUD is to make a set of utilities for faster development of CRUD web applications.
